  "summary": "Implemented a centralized frontend public-domain configuration (VITE_PUBLIC_DOMAIN + fallbacks), updated marketing header/footer logo URLs to use it, added a read-only Public Domain item to the setup checklist UI, and updated the standalone static landing page to use a single domain constant for asset URL construction. Deployment docs include a new \"Changing the Domain\" section but the provided diff snippet is truncated before confirming all required details.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Deployment documentation must explicitly list all project locations affected by a domain change (including the standalone landing page) and explain how to keep the React app domain setting and standalone landing page domain setting in sync.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a new \"Changing the Domain\" section, but the visible content is truncated before it demonstrates (a) an explicit list of all affected locations and (b) explicit instructions to update/keep in sync the standalone landing page setting alongside the React app setting.",
