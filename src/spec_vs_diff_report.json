However, the diff summary provides no visible evidence that the standalone landing page contact numbers were updated (REQ-2) or that tel/sms/wa.me deep links were adjusted to strip non-digits after adding the prefix (REQ-3). Additionally, project tracking/summary files were modified without being requested.",

      "reason": "The provided truncation of frontend/static/growwithtutor-standalone/script.js does not show any CONTENT.contact.whatsapp/CONTENT.contact.phone fields nor any wa.me link generation/normalization logic, so there is no evidence the numbers were updated or that non-digit stripping for wa.me is in place.",

      "reason": "No diff evidence is shown for React components/pages where tel:, sms:, or wa.me links are constructed/used, and the standalone script truncation does not show digit-stripping logic. Therefore, it cannot be verified that deep links now contain only digits.",
