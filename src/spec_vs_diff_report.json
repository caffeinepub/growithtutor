  "summary": "REQ-2 appears to be implemented via an added/expanded mainnet production deployment section in `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md`. REQ-1 (actually performing/ensuring a successful mainnet deploy and confirming reachability/verification) is not demonstrably implemented from the provided diff summary, and several code changes (backend access control + frontend logo/public domain configuration) look unrelated to the requested deployment-only scope.",

      "requirement": "Prepare and execute a production deployment for Version 30 to the Internet Computer mainnet, ensuring the deployed production canisters (backend + frontend) are accessible via the mainnet canister URLs and are not subject to draft expiration.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows documentation updates and code/config changes, but does not include evidence of actual mainnet deployment preparation/execution artifacts (e.g., CI/release scripts, `dfx.json`/canister config updates, pinned canister IDs, or any deployment output/verification results). From the diff alone, it cannot be confirmed that `dfx deploy --network ic` was run successfully, that canisters are accessible via mainnet URLs, or that post-deploy verification was performed.",
