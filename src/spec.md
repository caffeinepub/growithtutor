# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Ensure all public URL generation in production resolves to `growithtutor.com`.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the app’s public domain configuration so `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` (and helpers like `getPublicUrl` / `getPublicAssetUrl`) produce `https://growithtutor.com/...` in production builds.
- Update the standalone landing page configuration so `STANDALONE_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is set to `growithtutor.com` and its asset URL helper resolves to `https://growithtutor.com/...`.
- Ensure no edits are made to the listed immutable frontend paths.

**User-visible outcome:** Links and asset URLs generated by the app and the standalone landing page consistently point to `https://growithtutor.com/...` in production.
